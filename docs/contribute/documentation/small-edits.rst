Small edits
===========

For small edits to the documentation, use the GitHub web interface.

#.  On every page in documentation, on the right-hand side, there is a link :guilabel:`Edit on GitHub`.
    When you click that link, you'll be taken to GitHub's web interface where you can edit files.

    Alternatively, for narrative documentation files, you can navigate into the `docs <https://github.com/collective/icalendar/tree/main/docs>`_ directory to find the source file to edit.
    For :doc:`API reference documentation files </reference/api/icalendar>`, you can instead navigate into the `src <https://github.com/collective/icalendar/tree/main/docs>`_ directory.
    For either file type, you can then click the :guilabel:`pencil icon` to edit the file in the browser.
