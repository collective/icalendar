History
-------
`Max M <http://www.mxm.dk>`_ had often needed to parse and generate iCalendar files.
Finally, he got tired of writing ad-hoc tools.
This package is his attempt at making an iCalendar package for Python.
The inspiration has come from the email package in the standard library, which he thinks is pretty simple, yet efficient and powerful.
