        An access classification is only one component of the

        calendar entry.  The access classification of an individual
        iCalendar component is useful when measured along with the other
        security components of a calendar system (e.g., calendar user
        authentication, authorization, access rights, access role, etc.).
        Hence, the semantics of the individual access classifications
        cannot be completely defined by this memo alone.  Additionally,
        due to the "blind" nature of most exchange processes using this
        memo, these access classifications cannot serve as an enforcement
        statement for a system receiving an iCalendar object.  Rather,
        they provide a method for capturing the intention of the calendar
        owner for the access to the calendar component.  If not specified
