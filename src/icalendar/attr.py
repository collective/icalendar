    """The RDATE property defines the list of DATE-TIME values for recurring components.

    RDATE is defined in :rfc:`5545`.
    The return value is a list of tuples ``(start, end)``.

    ``start`` can be a :class:`datetime.date` or a :class:`datetime.datetime`,
    with and without timezone.

    ``end`` is :obj:`None` if the end is not specified and a :class:`datetime.datetime`
    if the end is specified.

    Value Type:
        The default value type for this property is DATE-TIME.
        The value type can be set to DATE or PERIOD.

    Property Parameters:
        IANA, non-standard, value data type, and time
        zone identifier property parameters can be specified on this
        property.

    Conformance:
        This property can be specified in recurring "VEVENT",
        "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL" calendar components as well as in the
        "STANDARD" and "DAYLIGHT" sub-components of the "VTIMEZONE"
        calendar component.

    Description:
        This property can appear along with the "RRULE"
        property to define an aggregate set of repeating occurrences.
        When they both appear in a recurring component, the recurrence
        instances are defined by the union of occurrences defined by both
        the "RDATE" and "RRULE".

        The recurrence dates, if specified, are used in computing the
        recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete set of
        recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
        is generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along
        with the "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties contained
        within the recurring component.  The "DTSTART" property defines
        the first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTSTART" property
        value SHOULD match the pattern of the recurrence rule, if
        specified.  The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property
        value that doesn't match the pattern of the rule is undefined.
        The final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the
        start DATE-TIME values generated by any of the specified "RRULE"
        and "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME
        values specified by "EXDATE" properties.  This implies that start
        DATE-TIME values specified by "EXDATE" properties take precedence
        over those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and
        "RRULE").  Where duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE"
        and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
        Duplicate instances are ignored.

    Example:
        Below, we set one RDATE in a list and get the resulting tuple of start and end.

        .. code-block:: pycon

            >>> from icalendar import Event
            >>> from datetime import datetime
            >>> event = Event()

            >>> event.add("RDATE", [datetime(2025, 4, 28, 16, 5)])
            >>> event.rdates
            [(datetime.datetime(2025, 4, 28, 16, 5), None)]

    .. note::

        You cannot modify the RDATE value by modifying the result.
        Use :func:`icalendar.cal.Component.add` to add values.

        If you want to compute recurrences, have a look at :ref:`Related projects`.

    EXDATE is defined in :rfc:`5545`.

    Value Type:

        and "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME

        "RRULE").  When duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE"
        and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
        Duplicate instances are ignored.

        The "EXDATE" property can be used to exclude the value specified
        in "DTSTART".  However, in such cases, the original "DTSTART" date
        MUST still be maintained by the calendaring and scheduling system
        because the original "DTSTART" value has inherent usage
        dependencies by other properties such as the "RECURRENCE-ID".

    Example:
        Below, we add an exdate in a list and get the resulting list of exdates.

def _get_rrules(self: Component) -> list[vRecur]:
    """RRULE defines a rule or repeating pattern for recurring components.

    RRULE is defined in :rfc:`5545`.
    :rfc:`7529` adds the ``SKIP`` parameter :class:`icalendar.prop.vSkip`.

    Property Parameters:
        IANA and non-standard property parameters can
        be specified on this property.

    Conformance:
        This property can be specified in recurring "VEVENT",

        calendar component, but it SHOULD NOT be specified more than once.
        The recurrence set generated with multiple "RRULE" properties is
        undefined.

    Description:
        The recurrence rule, if specified, is used in computing
        the recurrence set.  The recurrence set is the complete set of
        recurrence instances for a calendar component.  The recurrence set
        is generated by considering the initial "DTSTART" property along
        with the "RRULE", "RDATE", and "EXDATE" properties contained
        within the recurring component.  The "DTSTART" property defines
        the first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTSTART" property
        value SHOULD be synchronized with the recurrence rule, if
        specified.  The recurrence set generated with a "DTSTART" property
        value not synchronized with the recurrence rule is undefined.  The
        final recurrence set is generated by gathering all of the start
        DATE-TIME values generated by any of the specified "RRULE" and
        "RDATE" properties, and then excluding any start DATE-TIME values
        specified by "EXDATE" properties.  This implies that start DATE-
        TIME values specified by "EXDATE" properties take precedence over
        those specified by inclusion properties (i.e., "RDATE" and
        "RRULE").  Where duplicate instances are generated by the "RRULE"
        and "RDATE" properties, only one recurrence is considered.
        Duplicate instances are ignored.

        The "DTSTART" property specified within the iCalendar object
        defines the first instance of the recurrence.  In most cases, a
        "DTSTART" property of DATE-TIME value type used with a recurrence
        rule, should be specified as a date with local time and time zone
        reference to make sure all the recurrence instances start at the
        same local time regardless of time zone changes.

        If the duration of the recurring component is specified with the
        "DTEND" or "DUE" property, then the same exact duration will apply
        to all the members of the generated recurrence set.  Else, if the
        duration of the recurring component is specified with the
        "DURATION" property, then the same nominal duration will apply to
        all the members of the generated recurrence set and the exact
        duration of each recurrence instance will depend on its specific
        start time.  For example, recurrence instances of a nominal
        duration of one day will have an exact duration of more or less
        than 24 hours on a day where a time zone shift occurs.  The
        duration of a specific recurrence may be modified in an exception
        component or simply by using an "RDATE" property of PERIOD value
        type.

    Examples:
        Daily for 10 occurrences:

        .. code-block:: pycon

            >>> from icalendar import Event
            >>> from datetime import datetime

    Description:

Property Parameters:
    IANA and non-standard property parameters can be specified on this property.

Conformance:
    The property can be specified in "VEVENT", "VTODO", or
    "VJOURNAL" calendar component.

Description:
    When a calendar component is created, its sequence
    number is 0.  It is monotonically incremented by the "Organizer's"
    CUA each time the "Organizer" makes a significant revision to the
    calendar component.

    The "Organizer" includes this property in an iCalendar object that
    it sends to an "Attendee" to specify the current version of the
    calendar component.

    The "Attendee" includes this property in an iCalendar object that
    it sends to the "Organizer" to specify the version of the calendar
    component to which the "Attendee" is referring.

    A change to the sequence number is not the mechanism that an
    "Organizer" uses to request a response from the "Attendees".  The
    "RSVP" parameter on the "ATTENDEE" property is used by the
    "Organizer" to indicate that a response from the "Attendees" is
    requested.

    Recurrence instances of a recurring component MAY have different
    sequence numbers.

Examples:
    The following is an example of this property for a calendar
    component that was just created by the "Organizer":

        >>> from icalendar import Event
        >>> event = Event()

    The following is an example of this property for a calendar
    component that has been revised 10 different times by the
    "Organizer":

    .. code-block:: pycon

        >>> from icalendar import Calendar

Conformance:
    The property can be specified within "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar
    components.
    Since :rfc:`7986` it can also be defined on a "VCALENDAR" component.

Description:
    This property is used to specify categories or subtypes

    Within the "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components,
    more than one category can be specified as a COMMA-separated list

    iCalendar object that specifies only a time zone definition or

    components, but are components only on a single user's calendar.

Description:
    This property MUST only be specified within calendar
    components to specify participants, non-participants, and the
    chair of a group-scheduled calendar entity.  The property is
    specified within an "EMAIL" category of the "VALARM" calendar
    component to specify an email address that is to receive the email

Examples:
    Add a new attendee to an existing event.

    .. code-block:: pycon

uid_property = single_string_property(

    """UID specifies the persistent, globally unique identifier for a component.

We recommend using :func:`uuid.uuid4` to generate new values.

Returns:
    The value of the UID property as a string or ``""`` if no value is set.

Description:
    The "UID" itself MUST be a globally unique identifier.
    The generator of the identifier MUST guarantee that the identifier
    is unique.

    This is the method for correlating scheduling messages with the
    referenced "VEVENT", "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar component.
    The full range of calendar components specified by a recurrence
    set is referenced by referring to just the "UID" property value
    corresponding to the calendar component.  The "RECURRENCE-ID"
    property allows the reference to an individual instance within the
    recurrence set.

    This property is an important method for group-scheduling
    applications to match requests with later replies, modifications,
    or deletion requests.  Calendaring and scheduling applications
    MUST generate this property in "VEVENT", "VTODO", and "VJOURNAL"
    calendar components to assure interoperability with other group-
    scheduling applications.  This identifier is created by the
    calendar system that generates an iCalendar object.

    Implementations MUST be able to receive and persist values of at
    least 255 octets for this property, but they MUST NOT truncate
    values in the middle of a UTF-8 multi-octet sequence.

    :rfc:`7986` states that UID can be used, for
    example, to identify duplicate calendar streams that a client may
    have been given access to.  It can be used in conjunction with the
    "LAST-MODIFIED" property also specified on the "VCALENDAR" object
    to identify the most recent version of a calendar.

Conformance:
    :rfc:`5545` states that the "UID" property can be specified on "VEVENT", "VTODO",
    and "VJOURNAL" calendar components.
    :rfc:`7986` modifies the definition of the "UID" property to
    allow it to be defined in an iCalendar object.
    :rfc:`9074`  adds a "UID" property to "VALARM" components to allow a unique
    identifier to be specified. The value of this property can then be used
    to refer uniquely to the "VALARM" component.

    This property can be specified once only.

Security:
    :rfc:`7986` states that UID values MUST NOT include any data that
    might identify a user, host, domain, or any other security- or
    privacy-sensitive information.  It is RECOMMENDED that calendar user
    agents now generate "UID" values that are hex-encoded random
    Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) values as defined in
    Sections 4.4 and 4.5 of :rfc:`4122`.
    You can use the :mod:`uuid` module to generate new UUIDs.

Compatibility:
    For Alarms, ``X-ALARMUID`` is also considered.

Examples:
    The following is an example of such a property value:
    ``5FC53010-1267-4F8E-BC28-1D7AE55A7C99``.

    Set the UID of a calendar:

    .. code-block:: pycon

    memo, these access classifications cannot serve as an enforcement
    statement for a system receiving an iCalendar object.  Rather,
    they provide a method for capturing the intention of the calendar
    owner for the access to the calendar component.  If not specified
    in a component that allows this property, the default value is
    PUBLIC.  Applications MUST treat x-name and iana-token values they
    don't recognize the same way as they would the PRIVATE value.

Description:
    Time Transparency is the characteristic of an event
    that determines whether it appears to consume time on a calendar.
    Events that consume actual time for the individual or resource
    associated with the calendar SHOULD be recorded as OPAQUE,
    allowing them to be detected by free/busy time searches.  Other
    events, which do not take up the individual's (or resource's) time
    SHOULD be recorded as TRANSPARENT, making them invisible to free/
    busy time searches.

Description:
    In a group-scheduled calendar component, the property

    to the "Attendees".  For example in a "VEVENT" calendar component,
    the "Organizer" can indicate that a meeting is tentative,
    confirmed, or cancelled.  In a "VTODO" calendar component, the
    "Organizer" can indicate that an action item needs action, is
    completed, is in process or being worked on, or has been
    cancelled.  In a "VJOURNAL" calendar component, the "Organizer"
    can indicate that a journal entry is draft, final, or has been
    cancelled or removed.

    The following is an example of this property with an alternate
    representation of a MIME body part containing the contact
    information, such as a vCard :rfc:`2426` embedded in a text/
    directory media type :rfc:`2425`:
