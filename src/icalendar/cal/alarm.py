    Purpose: This property specifies the UTC date and time at which the

    This property is used to specify when an alarm was last sent or acknowledged.
    This allows clients to determine when a pending alarm has been acknowledged
    by a calendar user so that any alerts can be dismissed across multiple devices.
    It also allows clients to track repeating alarms or alarms on recurring events or
    to-dos to ensure that the right number of missed alarms can be tracked.

    Clients SHOULD set this property to the current date-time value in UTC
    when a calendar user acknowledges a pending alarm. Certain kinds of alarms,
    such as email-based alerts, might not provide feedback as to when the calendar user
    sees them. For those kinds of alarms, the client SHOULD set this property
    when the alarm is triggered and the action is successfully carried out.

    When an alarm is triggered on a client, clients can check to see if an "ACKNOWLEDGED"
    property is present. If it is, and the value of that property is greater than or
    equal to the computed trigger time for the alarm, then the client SHOULD NOT trigger
    the alarm. Similarly, if an alarm has been triggered and
    an "alert" has been presented to a calendar user, clients can monitor
    the iCalendar data to determine whether an "ACKNOWLEDGED" property is added or
    changed in the alarm component. If the value of any "ACKNOWLEDGED" property
    in the alarm changes and is greater than or equal to the trigger time of the alarm,
    then clients SHOULD dismiss or cancel any "alert" presented to the calendar user.
