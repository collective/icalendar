        Description:
            A "VJOURNAL" calendar component is a grouping of
            component properties that represent one or more descriptive text
            notes associated with a particular calendar date.  The "DTSTART"
            property is used to specify the calendar date with which the
            journal entry is associated.  Generally, it will have a DATE value
            data type, but it can also be used to specify a DATE-TIME value
            data type.  Examples of a journal entry include a daily record of
            a legislative body or a journal entry of individual telephone
            contacts for the day or an ordered list of accomplishments for the
            day.

    Examples:

            >>> from icalendar import Journal
            >>> journal = Journal.new()
            >>> print(journal.to_ical())
