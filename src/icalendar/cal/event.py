class Event(Component):
    """A grouping of component properties that describe an event.

    Description:
        A "VEVENT" calendar component is a grouping of
        component properties, possibly including "VALARM" calendar
        components, that represents a scheduled amount of time on a
        calendar.  For example, it can be an activity; such as a one-hour
        long, department meeting from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM, tomorrow.
        Generally, an event will take up time on an individual calendar.
        Hence, the event will appear as an opaque interval in a search for
        busy time.  Alternately, the event can have its Time Transparency
        set to "TRANSPARENT" in order to prevent blocking of the event in
        searches for busy time.

        The "VEVENT" is also the calendar component used to specify an
        anniversary or daily reminder within a calendar.  These events
        have a DATE value type for the "DTSTART" property instead of the
        default value type of DATE-TIME.  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DTEND"
        property, it MUST be specified as a DATE value also.  The
        anniversary type of "VEVENT" can span more than one date (i.e.,
        "DTEND" property value is set to a calendar date after the
        "DTSTART" property value).  If such a "VEVENT" has a "DURATION"
        property, it MUST be specified as a "dur-day" or "dur-week" value.

        The "DTSTART" property for a "VEVENT" specifies the inclusive
        start of the event.  For recurring events, it also specifies the
        very first instance in the recurrence set.  The "DTEND" property
        for a "VEVENT" calendar component specifies the non-inclusive end
        of the event.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
        specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE value type but no
        "DTEND" nor "DURATION" property, the event's duration is taken to
        be one day.  For cases where a "VEVENT" calendar component
        specifies a "DTSTART" property with a DATE-TIME value type but no
        "DTEND" property, the event ends on the same calendar date and
        time of day specified by the "DTSTART" property.

        The "VEVENT" calendar component cannot be nested within another
        calendar component.  However, "VEVENT" calendar components can be
        related to each other or to a "VTODO" or to a "VJOURNAL" calendar
        component with the "RELATED-TO" property.

    Examples:
        The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar
        component used to represent a meeting that will also be opaque to
        searches for busy time:

        .. code-block:: text

            BEGIN:VEVENT
            UID:19970901T130000Z-123401@example.com

            DTSTART:19970903T163000Z
            DTEND:19970903T190000Z
            SUMMARY:Annual Employee Review
            CLASS:PRIVATE
            CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
            END:VEVENT

        The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
        used to represent a reminder that will not be opaque, but rather
        transparent, to searches for busy time:

        .. code-block:: text

            BEGIN:VEVENT
            UID:19970901T130000Z-123402@example.com
            DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z
            DTSTART:19970401T163000Z
            DTEND:19970402T010000Z
            SUMMARY:Laurel is in sensitivity awareness class.
            CLASS:PUBLIC
            CATEGORIES:BUSINESS,HUMAN RESOURCES
            TRANSP:TRANSPARENT
            END:VEVENT

        The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
        used to represent an anniversary that will occur annually:

        .. code-block:: text

            BEGIN:VEVENT
            UID:19970901T130000Z-123403@example.com
            DTSTAMP:19970901T130000Z

            END:VEVENT

        The following is an example of the "VEVENT" calendar component
        used to represent a multi-day event scheduled from June 28th, 2007
        to July 8th, 2007 inclusively.  Note that the "DTEND" property is
        set to July 9th, 2007, since the "DTEND" property specifies the
        non-inclusive end of the event.

        .. code-block:: text

            BEGIN:VEVENT
            UID:20070423T123432Z-541111@example.com
