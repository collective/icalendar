          # The way the action should handle pathspec errors from the add and remove commands. Three options are available:
          # - ignore -> errors will be logged but the step won't fail
          # - exitImmediately -> the action will stop right away, and the step will fail
          # - exitAtEnd -> the action will go on, every pathspec error will be logged at the end, the step will fail.
          # Default: ignore
          pathspec_error_handling: ignore

          # Whether to push the commit and, if any, its tags to the repo. It can also be used to set the git push arguments (see the paragraph below for more info)
          # Default: true
          push: true
