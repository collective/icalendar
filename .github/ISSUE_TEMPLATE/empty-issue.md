This is an unstructured issue template to use if you don't need guidance.

Here are some hints, though.

- Add example `.ics` files, if relevant.
- Show code.
- Show logs, stack traces, error output, or other output that differs from what you expect.
- Add links to related issues or pull requests.

Thanks for taking your time to report this!
